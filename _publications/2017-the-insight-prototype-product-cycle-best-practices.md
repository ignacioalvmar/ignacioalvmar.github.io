## Abstract

In-vehicle experiences are made up mainly of mundane small moments,
repeated practices, and taken-for-granted decisions that make up daily experiences
in and around private passenger vehicles. Understanding what those experiences are
for drivers around the world presents an opportunity for designing novel interactive
experiences, technologies, and user interfaces for vehicles. In this chapter, we
present a set of tools, methodologies, and practices that will help reader create a
holistic design space for future mobility. Transitioning between ethnography,
insights, prototyping, experience design, and requirements decomposition is a
challenging task even for experienced UX professionals. This chapter provides
guidance in this matter with practical examples.

## Key Contributions

* Ethnographic research methods for Automotive System Development
* Rapid prototyping methods for Automotive Functions
* Experience Design mapping to product specifications
* Product Development evaluation and validation
* Product Success metrics
