## Abstract

Automated driving systems (ADS), especially in higher levels of automation, seem to be the new focus of innovation regarding future mobility. Technological achievements of traveling automation open up new challenges for road traffic. Existing automotive research focuses on problem solving and observational approaches including users and their imagination of the future of mobility to analyze acceptance and user experience of "incremental" (step-wised improved) innovations. On the other hand, "radical" (something new, enabled by technology or meaning change) innovations extensively increase product quality leaping over incremental innovation. This workshop aims to challenge the current research approaches to automated driving against "trying to improve sitting in a horse carriage" and discuss how we can design "radical" innovations for ADS beyond the "horse carriage". Within this interactive workshop, we will utilize a design thinking approach to refocus on underlying problems that ADSs originally aim to solve and generate ideas for radical innovations.

## Key Contributions

* Critiques incremental innovation in ADS research
* Promotes designing ADS as radical innovation
* Applies a design thinking approach
* Utilizes rapid prototyping for radical ideas
* Refocuses on problems ADS should solve
