## Abstract

Informing a driver of a vehicle's changing state and environment is a major challenge that grows with the introduction of in-vehicle assistant and infotainment systems. Even in the age of automation, the human will need to be in the loop for monitoring, taking over control, or making decisions. In these cases, poorly designed systems could lead to needless attentional demands imparted on the driver, taking it away from the primary driving task. Existing systems are offering simple and often unspecific alerts, leaving the human with the demanding task of identifying, localizing, and understanding the problem. Ideally, such systems should communicate information in a way that conveys its relevance and urgency. Specifically, information useful to promote driver safety should be conveyed as effective calls for action, while information not pertaining to safety (therefore less important) should be conveyed in ways that do not jeopardize driver attention. Adaptive ambient displays and peripheral interactions have the potential to provide superior solutions and could serve to unobtrusively present information, to shift the driver's attention according to changing task demands, or enable a driver to react without losing the focus on the primary task. In order to build a common understanding across researchers and practitioners from different fields, we held a Workshop on Adaptive Ambient In-Vehicle Displays and Interactions at the AutomotiveUI`15 conference. In this chapter, we discuss the outcomes of this workshop, provide examples of possible applications now or in the future and conclude with challenges in developing or using adaptive ambient interactions.
