## Abstract

Research on next generation automotive ICT is challenged by the complex interactions of technological advancements and the social nature of individuals using and adopting technology. Traffic in the future will no longer be considered as a network of individually behaving “dumb” cars, but rather as the entirety of social interactions between its entities. Successful application of collective, socially inspired driving mechanisms requires to understand how socially-inspired vehicles (i.e., driver-car pairs) could make use of their social habitus, composed from (past and present) driving behavior, social interactions with pedestrians, vehicles, infrastructure, etc., and drivers’ vital states when exposed to other road participants in live traffic. In response to this emerging research direction, the aim of this workshop is to achieve a common understanding of the symbiosis between drivers, cars, and infrastructure from a global point of view (referred to as “collective driving”). In particular, this workshop is expected to provoke an active debate on the adequacy of the concept of socializing cars, addressing questions such as who can communicate what, when, how, and why?
