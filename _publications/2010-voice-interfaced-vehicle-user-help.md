## Abstract

Manuals were designed to provide support and information about the usage and maintenance of the vehicle. In many cases user's manuals are the driver's only guidance. However, lack of clarity and efficiency of manuals lead to user dissatisfaction. In vehicles this problem is even more crucial given that driving a motor vehicle is, for many people, the most complex and potentially dangerous task they will perform during their lifetime. In this paper we present a voice interfaced driver manual that can potentially fix the deficiencies of its alternatives. In addition we aim to provide a case for the integration of such technology in a vehicle to reduce driver distraction, increase driver satisfaction, and manual usability, while also benefiting Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in lowering costs and reducing the documentation process.
