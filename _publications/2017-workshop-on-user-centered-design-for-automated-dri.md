## Abstract

Automated driving systems (ADS) are mainly regarded from an innovation and technology-centered perspective. In academia, as well as in industry, there is a concentration on technical issues to maintain competitiveness while aspects like acceptance, trust and user experience are widely under-researched. However, the "human factor" is critical for a comprehensive establishment of ADS technology on the market. We believe that there is a need to focus on a user-centered design (UCD) perspective to bring ADS innovation to a next level and to achieve a wide acceptance in society. In this workshop we want to discuss special requirements of UCD applied to ADS, to address challenges and opportunities and to reveal new research fields for future work.

## Key Contributions

* Proposes migration-tolerant ATC display concept
* Advocates for stepwise functionality introduction
* Compares small versus large integration steps
* Measures usability, learnability, and acceptance
