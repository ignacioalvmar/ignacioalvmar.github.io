## Abstract

On July 1st 2016, the first automated vehicle fatality became headline news [9] and caused a nationwide wave of concern. Now we have at least one situation in which a controlled automated vehicle system failed to detect a life threatening situation. The question still remains: How can an autonomous system make ethical decisions that involve human lives? Control negotiation strategies require prior encoding of ethical conventions into decision making algorithms, which is not at all an easy task -- especially considering that actually coming up with ethically sound decision strategies in the first place is often very difficult, even for human agents. This workshop seeks to provide a forum for experts across different backgrounds to voice and formalize the ethical aspects of automotive user interfaces in the context of automated driving. The goal is to derive working principles that will guide shared decision-making between human drivers and their automated vehicles.

## Key Contributions

* Discusses ethical dilemmas in automated driving
* Analyzes the limits of Asimov's Automation Laws
* Questions human vs. machine decision-making
* Addresses cultural differences in moral norms
* Seeks to formalize ethics for algorithms
