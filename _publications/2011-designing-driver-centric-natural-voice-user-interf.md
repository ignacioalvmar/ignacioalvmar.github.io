## Abstract

The current growth of automotive electronics aims toextend vehicle functionality and information access. Thispaper explores the application of Natural Voice UserInterfaces as a preferred interaction modality with in-vehicle technologies to lower driver distraction effects andimprove the user experience. The benefits and risks ofnatural speech interactions are evaluated in order topropose a driver-centric design guideline based on previousresearch. The paper concludes that driving scenarios canprofit considerably from systems that apply natural speechinterfaces to allow the driver to access information.
