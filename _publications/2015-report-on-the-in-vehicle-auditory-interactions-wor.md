## Abstract

As driving is mainly a visual task, auditory displays play a critical role for in-vehicle interactions. To improve invehicle auditory interactions to the advanced level, auditory display researchers and automotive user interface researchers came together to discuss this timely topic at an in-vehicle auditory interactions workshop at the International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD). The present paper reports discussion outcomes from the workshop for more discussions at the AutoUI conference.

## Key Contributions

* Workshop organization and community building
* Designed sounds for automated driving take-overs
* Proposed interactive music for eco-driving
* Considered auditory displays for passengers
* Taxonomized auditory collision warning issues
* Bridged auditory and automotive UI communities
