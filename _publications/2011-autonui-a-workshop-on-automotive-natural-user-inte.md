## Abstract

Natural user interfaces by means of gesture and speech interaction have become a hot topic in research as well as already for real products. Most use cases currently center around consumer electronics devices like smart phones, TV sets, gaming, or other large screens like tabletops.
Motivated by the latest results in those areas, our vision is to apply natural user interfaces like gesture and speech interaction to the automotive domain as well. This integration might on one hand reduce driver distraction in certain cases and on the other hand allow to design new experiences for operating infotainment and entertainment systems.
The goal of this workshop is to explore the design space of natural multi-modal automotive user interfaces. We would like to analyze where and how new interaction techniques can be integrated into the car.
