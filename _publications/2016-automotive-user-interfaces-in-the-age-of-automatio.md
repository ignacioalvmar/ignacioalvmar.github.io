## Abstract

The next big change in the automotive domain will be the move towards automated and semi-automated driving. We can expect an increasing level of autonomous driving in the coming years, resulting in new opportunities for the car as an infotainment platform when standard driving tasks will be automated. This change also comes with a number of challenges to automotive user interfaces. Core challenges for the assistance system and the user interface will be distributing tasks between the assistance system and the driver, the re-engagement of drivers in semi-automated driving back to the driving task, and collaborative driving in which cars collectively work together (e.g., platoons). Overall, in the coming years we will need to design interfaces and applications that make driving safe while enabling communication, work, and play in human-operated vehicles. This Dagstuhl seminar brought together researchers from human computer interaction, cognitive psychology, human factors psychology and also from automotive industry and OEMs to discuss the new interface paradigms for (semi-)automated driving.
