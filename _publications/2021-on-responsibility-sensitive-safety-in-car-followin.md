## Abstract

The need for safety in automated driving is undisputed. Since automated vehicles are expected to reduce the number of fatalities in road traffic significantly, hundreds of millions of test kilometers would be required for statistical safety validation [1]. Physics-based safety verification approaches are promising in order to reduce this validation effort. Towards this goal, Mobileye introduced the concept of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS). In RSS, bounds for the reasonable worst-case behavior of traffic participants are assumed to be given, such as the reaction time or the maximum deceleration. These parameters have a crucial effect on the applicability of the approach: choosing conservative parameters likely hinders traffic flow, while the opposite could lead to collisions, as the assumptions are violated. Thus, in this work, we focus on finding reasonable parameters of RSS. Based on the physical limits, legal requirements and human driving behavior, we propose scopes and parameter sets that allow for a sound safety verification while not hindering traffic flow. Furthermore, we present an approach that explains seemingly frequent human drivers' RSS violations on highways and may lead to a useful extension of RSS.
