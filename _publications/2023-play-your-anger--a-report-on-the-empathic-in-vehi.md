## Abstract

Empathic in-vehicle interfaces are critical in improving user safety and experiences. There has been much research on how to estimate drivers’ affective states, whereas little research has investigated intervention methods that mitigate potential impacts from the driver’s affective states on their driving performance and user experiences. To enhance the development of in-vehicle interfaces considering emotional aspects, we have organized a workshop series to gather automotive user interface experts to discuss this topic at the International ACM Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications (AutoUI). The present paper focuses particularly on the intervention methods created by the experts and proposes design recommendations for future empathic in-vehicle interfaces. We hope this work can spark lively discussions on the importance of drivers’ affective states in their user experience of automated vehicles and pose the right direction.

## Key Contributions

* Presents novel empathic interface prototypes.
* Offers expert-driven design recommendations.
* Addresses anger, frustration, and fear.
* Details a three-phase design process.
* Focuses on specific intervention methods.
