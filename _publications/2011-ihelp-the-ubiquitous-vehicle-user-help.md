## Abstract

Voice-interfaced, in-vehicle assistance includes receiving a Voice-based query from a user in the vehicle, and then determining at least one of a user emotional state, user expertise level and speech recognition confidence level associated with the Voice-based query. A text-based query may then be derived from the Voice-based query, and used to search a help database for answers corresponding to the Voice-based query.
At least one response is then provided to the user in the form of Voice-based assistance in accordance with at least one of the user emotional state, user expertise level and speech recognition confidence level.
