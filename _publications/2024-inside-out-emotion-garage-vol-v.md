## Abstract

The rapid advancement of automated vehicles has aroused the curiosity of researchers in the automotive field. Understanding the emotional aspects of this technology is critical to improving human-vehicle interactions. The topics of the proposed workshop will be expanded from internal to external empathetic interface designs of automated vehicles. The workshop will gather researchers and practitioners to brainstorm and design affective internal and external interfaces for automated vehicles, targeting specific use cases within the social context. During the workshop, participants will use an affective design tool and generative AI to prototype affective interface designs in automated vehicles. With this creative approach, we aim to expand the knowledge of affective eHMIs in addition to in-vehicle designs and understand social factors that contribute to the user perceptions of automated vehicles.

## Key Contributions

* Emotional and affective computing
* Expands focus to external vehicle interfaces
* Aims to create design guidelines
* Addresses social context and ethical issues
* Prototype affective interface designs
