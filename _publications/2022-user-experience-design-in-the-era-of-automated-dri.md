## Abstract

This book is dedicated to user experience design for automated driving to address humane aspects of automated driving, e.g., workload, safety, trust, ethics, and acceptance. Automated driving has experienced a major development boost in recent years. However, most of the research and implementation has been technology-driven, rather than human-centered. The levels of automated driving have been poorly defined and inconsistently used. A variety of application scenarios and restrictions has been ambiguous. Also, it deals with human factors, design practices and methods, as well as applications, such as multimodal infotainment, virtual reality, augmented reality, and interactions in and outside users. This book aims at 1) providing engineers, designers, and practitioners with a broad overview of the state-of-the-art user experience research in automated driving to speed-up the implementation of automated vehicles and 2) helping researchers and students benefit from various perspectives and approaches to generate new research ideas and conduct more integrated research.
