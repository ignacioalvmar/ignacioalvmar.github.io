## Abstract

This thesis presents the design and development of the Conversational Automotive Assistant, Voice User Help, a conversational system based on the question-answer paradigm and designed to consult vehicle documentation while driving. This work compiles research in the fields of technical documentation, information retrieval, natural language processing, vehicle user interface design, user experience, and affective computing with the goal of creating an adaptive and dynamic assistant that modifies its conversational behavior depending on the user's emotional state.

## Key Contributions

* Conversational Asistant for In-cabin Automotive Applications
* Information Retrieval Algorithms
* Human-Computer Interaction Voice Interfaces
* Automotive Context-aware Affective Computing
