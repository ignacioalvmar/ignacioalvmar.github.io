## Abstract

Safety Assurance remains a challenge for the large-scale deployment of Automated Driving Systems (ADS). Safety models monitor the performance of the ADS. Most safety models are validated both in simulation and during on-road tests. However, first-hand experiences and analysis of ADS safety models are not easily accessible to the general research community. This paper introduces the RSS driving demonstrator an open-source simulation tool that enables first-hand experience of the Responsibility Sensitive Safety (RSS) safety model proposed by Intel and Mobileye and adopted by several Automotive Industry standards and regulatory frameworks. The RSS demonstrator enables first-hand interactions and experience of ADS safety model restrictions in both automated and manual driving conditions. As a User Experience (UX) tool, it provides quantitative safety metrics and flexible user interaction features. The results indicate it served to both evangelize the RSS ADS safety model with laymen population and is a versatile tool for Automotive UX development.
