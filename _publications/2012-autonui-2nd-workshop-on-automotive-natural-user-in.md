## Abstract

Natural user interfaces—generally based on gesture and speech interaction—are an increasingly hot topic in research and are already being applied in a multitude of commercial products. Most use cases currently involve consumer electronics devices like smart phones, tablets, TV sets, game consoles, or large-screen tabletop computers.
Motivated by the latest results in those areas, our vision is to apply natural user interfaces, for example gesture and conversational speech interaction, to the automotive domain as well. This integration might on one hand reduce driver distraction in certain cases and on the other hand might allow the design of new user experiences for infotainment and entertainment systems.
