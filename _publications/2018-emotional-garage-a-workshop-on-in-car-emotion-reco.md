## Abstract

In-car emotion detection and regulation have become an emerging and important branch of research within the automotive domain. Different emotional states can greatly influence human driving performance and user experience both in manual and automated driving conditions. The monitoring and regulation of relevant emotional states is therefore important to avoid critical driving scenarios with the human driver being in charge, and to ensure comfort and acceptance in autonomous driving. In this workshop we want to discuss the empathic user interface research to address challenges and opportunities and to reveal new research directions for future work. This workshop provides a forum for exchange and discussion on empathic user interfaces, including methods for emotion recognition and regulation, empathic automotive human-machine interaction design, user evaluation and measurements, and subsequent improvement of autonomous driving experience.

## Key Contributions

* Discusses empathic in-car user interfaces
* Identifies critical scenarios and emotions
* Explores emotion recognition and regulation methods
* Uses 4mat system for workshop structure
* Creates roadmap for future research
