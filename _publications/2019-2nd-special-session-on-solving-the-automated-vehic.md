## Abstract

The scientific knowledge and tools for the mass deployment of Automated Vehicles (AVs) are maturing rapidly, as evidenced by the wide deployment of AV test fleets worldwide. These vehicles have the potential to produce tremendous economic and societal benefits including greatly reduced traffic accidents, injuries, and congestion, and to make less expensive, more flexible and more productive transportation available to all. But one challenge looms above all others in the race to full vehicle automation; solving the AV Safety Assurance challenge. Automated transportation is not just a product, but an industry. And it is as an industry that we must together solve this challenge. We invite researchers, automakers, technology companies, and government regulators to come together to develop a holistic model to define and measure AV Safety. In this special session we present papers that provide contributions to the definition, applicability and standardization of AV safety assurance, including methods for the development of metrics, benchmarks and evangelisation of AV Safety Assurances to users and the public. This session continues the open discussion started in 2018 ITSC with the goal of making AV Safety a reality. The session will consist of high quality paper presentations as well as a panel discussion with some of the most relevant figures of the AV industry.

## Key Contributions

* Common AV safety definition
* Fosters collaboration between industry and academia
* Seeks to specify AV safety standards
* Gathers a universal view on safety
