## Abstract

This paper outlines and evaluates experiential prototyping for emerging vehicle UX design within a pedagogical framework. Drawing from studio experience, we discuss the learnings, options and risks that in-vehicle UX designers face in prototyping realtime, adaptive user interfaces, and suggest methods and solutions for designers wishing to expand their creative practice.

## Key Contributions

* Presents a novel pedagogical framework for UX
* Applies “design thinking through making”
* Outlines low-tech experiential prototyping methods
* Advocates for Minimum Viable Prototypes
* Identifies risks in UX prototyping
