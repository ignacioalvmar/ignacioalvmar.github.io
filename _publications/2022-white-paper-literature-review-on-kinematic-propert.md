## Abstract 

This document presents a review of relevant literature (e.g., standards, regulations, and scientific publications) that investigated kinematic behavior of road users. This review is intended to serve as a key contribution to the Automated Driving Systems (ADS) research and industry communities, as well as to current standardization efforts, such as IEEE Std 2846, IEEE Standard for Assumptions in Safety-Related Models for Automated Driving Systems.

## Key Contributions

* Literature review road actors kinematic behavior
* Systematic data organization of kinematic parameter values
* Kinematic data contextualization
* Research gap analysis
