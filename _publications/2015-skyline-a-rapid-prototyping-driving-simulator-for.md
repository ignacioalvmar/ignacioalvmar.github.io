## Abstract

The search term “driver-vehicle interaction study” results in 2,690 Google Scholar hits of research papers published in the past 5 years (2010-2015). This huge number clearly points out the problem that researchers (particularly, new to this field) are exposed to, namely that many decisions regarding the setting, (e.g., lab/field, low-/high-fidelity simulator, within/between subjects, sample size, biased subject, learning effect, sensor technology, mobile hardware, synchronization issues, briefing, etc.) have to be established early in the design phase without the reference of principled guidelines and best practices to support the min identifying the optimal solution to answer their research question of interest. This workshop invites a) people activein the field to share their experiences in executing studies to measure driver behavior or vehicle conditions (driver-vehicle interactions), and b) young researchers to draft research questions, present their problems, and discuss possible solutions with the other participants.

## Key Contributions

* Addresses lack of research best practices
* Focuses on modeling driver, driving, interactions
* Connects new and experienced researchers
* Reviews sensors for user modeling
* Discusses experimental methods and settings
