## Abstract

This paper introduces Skyline, a user experience prototyping platform for automotive, developed in Intel Labs to enable rapid iterative development of in-vehicle experiences. The paper describes the hardware and software components of Skyline. It highlights the flexibility of the interior HMI configuration and the accessibility of the development platform, based on open source Web technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, Node.js and MQTT. The paper steps through the development and user testing processes for a cockpit experience with Skyline, illustrating the benefits of capturing early qualitative user feedback as support for rapid prototyping. Finally, the paper outlines the potential benefits of high fidelity assets developed on the platform for both industry and academia, and the enormous value that documented user experience HMI assets can have for in-vehicle feature productization and research.
