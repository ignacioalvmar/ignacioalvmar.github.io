## Abstract

The determination of safety assurances for automated driving vehicles is one of the most critical challenges in the industry today. Several behavioral safety models for automated driving have been proposed recently and standards discussions are on the way. In this paper we present a method to automatically explore the performance of automated vehicle (AV) safety models utilizing robustness of Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) specifications as a continuous metric of safety. We present a case study of the Responsibility Sensitive Safety model (RSS), introducing a safety evaluation pipeline based on the CARLA driving simulator, RSS and a set of safety-critical driving scenarios. Our method automatically extracts safety relevant profiles for these scenarios providing practical parametric boundaries for implementation. Furthermore, we evaluate the trade-offs between safety and utility within the safe RSS parameter space through a proposed naturalistic benchmark challenge that we open-sourced. We analyze different RSS parameter configurations including assertive and more conservative settings, extracted by our specification-driven framework. Our results show that while maintaining the safety boundaries, the extracted RSS configuration for assertive driving behavior achieves the highest utility.
