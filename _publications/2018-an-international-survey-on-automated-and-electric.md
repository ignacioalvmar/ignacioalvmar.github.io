## Abstract

As development of automated vehicles and adoption of electric vehicles continue to grow, there is an increasing interest in the public opinions on these technologies. We conducted an international online survey to gather information about people’s hopes and concerns for automated and electric vehicles from a total of 866 people from four countries – Austria, Germany, South Korea, and USA. Results revealed some differences across countries in the perceptions of automated and electric vehicles. However, differences between the same countries have shrunk compared to our previous survey completed in 2012. Results are discussed with limitations and future work.
