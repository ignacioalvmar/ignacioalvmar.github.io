## Abstract

A major challenge in today’s as well as future driving is to keep drivers informed about the vehicle’s state and the environment. Today’s assistant and infotainment systems compete for the drivers’ attention and may even distract them from the primary driving task. Further, with an increase in automation, the vehicle needs to be able to communicate information with different urgency levels. While some information are not important and should never distract a driver from important tasks, there are also calls for action, which a driver should not be able to ignore. We believe in adaptive ambient displays and peripheral interaction as one possible way to unobtrusively present information while being able to switch the driver’s attention if needed. In this workshop the focus lies in exchange of best known methods and discussion on challenges and potentials for this kind of interaction in today’s scenarios as well as in future mixed or full autonomous traffic. The central objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers from different domains and discuss radical, innovative, and engaging ideas and a future landscape for research in this area.

## Key Contributions

* Proposes workshop on adaptive ambient displays
* Focuses on ambient and peripheral interaction
* Addresses managing driver attention shifts
