## Abstract

The search term “driver-vehicle interaction study” results in2,690 Google Scholar hits of research papers published inthe past 5 years (2010-2015). This huge number clearlypoints out the problem that researchers (particularly, new tothis field) are exposed to, namely that many decisionsregarding the setting, (e.g., lab/field, low-/high-fidelitysimulator, within/between subjects, sample size, biasedsubject, learning effect, sensor technology, mobilehardware, synchronization issues, briefing, etc.) have to beestablished early in the design phase without the referenceof principled guidelines and best practices to support themin identifying the optimal solution to answer their researchquestion of interest. This workshop invites a) people activein the field to share their experiences in executing studies tomeasure driver behavior or vehicle conditions (driver-vehicle interactions), and b) young researchers to draftresearch questions, present their problems, and discusspossible solutions with the other participants.

## Key Contributions

* Addresses lack of research best practices
* Focuses on modeling driver, driving, interactions
* Connects new and experienced researchers
* Reviews sensors for user modeling
* Discusses experimental methods and settings
