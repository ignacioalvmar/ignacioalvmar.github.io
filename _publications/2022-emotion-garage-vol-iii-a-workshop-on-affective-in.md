## Abstract

Empathic in-vehicle interfaces can address driver affect and mitigate decreases in driving performance and behavior that are associated with emotional states. Empathic vehicles can detect and employ a variety of intervention modalities to change user affect and improve user experience. Challenges remain in the implementation of such strategies, as a broader established view of practical intervention modalities and strategies is still absent. Therefore, we propose a workshop that aims to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in affective interfaces and in-vehicle technologies as a forum for the development of displays and alternatives suitable to various use case situations in current and future vehicle states. During the workshop, we will focus on a common set of use cases and generate approaches that can suit different user groups. By the end of this workshop, researchers will create a design flowchart for in-vehicle affective display designers when creating displays for an empathic vehicle.
