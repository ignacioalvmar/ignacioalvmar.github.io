## Abstract

There is little doubt that driving generates emotional responses, whether thatâ€™s the joy of freedom, the boredom of stop-and-go traffic or anger towards unsafe maneuvers. In this chapter we provide an overview of emotion research applied to the automotive context and highlight the impact of emotional states in varying levels of driving automation. We review the most critical research findings on the impact of emotional states in driving performance including reaction time and take-over readiness. We also discuss the application of emotion regulation strategies related to the driving task. Finally, we analyze the research challenges still present for robust emotional classification and personalization in their application to in-vehicle interactions. This technology offers great potential for the development of emotionally-aware in-cabin driver assistants which will play a critical role in the future of automated driving user experience development.
