## Abstract

This standard applies to road vehicles. It defines a minimum set of reasonable assumptions and foreseeable scenarios that shall be considered in the development of safety related models that are part of an automated driving system (ADS).
Scope:
This standard applies to road vehicles. For a set of scenarios, a minimum set of assumptions regarding reasonably foreseeable behaviors of other road users are defined that shall be considered in the development of safety-related models for automated driving systems (ADS). This standard further defines a list of attributes common to contributed safety-related models and methods to help verify whether a safety-related model takes the minimum set of assumptions into consideration. An informative annex instantiates several examples of how the proposed minimum set of assumptions could be employed in ADS development. Sources of uncertainty, such as prediction or perception errors, are out of scope to this standard. This standard does not guarantee the safety of the overall system in all scenarios.
Purpose:
Government and Industry alike need an open, transparent, and technology-neutral standard that provides guidance useful for evaluating the performance of an ADS. This guidance consists of a minimum set of assumptions with bounds on reasonably foreseeable behaviors of other road users used in the development of safety-related models.
