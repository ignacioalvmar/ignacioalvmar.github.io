## Abstract

This workshop will focus on the problem of occupant and vehicle situational awareness with respect to automated vehicles when the driver must take over control. It will explore the future of fully automated and mixed traffic situations where vehicles are assumed to be operating at level 3 or above. In this case, all critical driving functions will be handled by the vehicle with the possibility of transitions between manual and automated driving modes at any time. This creates a driver environment where, unlike manual driving, there is no direct intrinsic motivation for the driver to be aware of the traffic situation at all times. Therefore, it is highly likely that when such a transition occurs, the driver will not be able to transition either safely or within an appropriate period of time. This workshop will address this challenge by inviting experts and practitioners from the automotive and related domains to explore concepts and solutions to increase, maintain and transfer situational awareness in semi-automated vehicles.

## Key Contributions

* Addresses driver situational awareness problem
* Focuses on take-over and handover situations
