## Abstract

Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to improve road safety, support more immersive (non-) driving related activities, and finally enhance driving experience. AR may also be the enabling technology to help on the transition towards automated driving. However, augmented reality still faces a number of technical challenges when applied in vehicles, and also several human factors issues need to be solved. In this workshop, we will discuss potential and constraints as well as impact, role, and adequacy of AR in driving applications. The primary goal of this workshop is to define a research agenda for the use of AR in intelligent vehicles within the next 3 to 5 years.

## Key Contributions

* Workshop organization and community building
* Defines a 3-5 year collaborative research agenda
* Identifies four key AR problem fields
* Discusses practical usage of AR devices
* Outlines research challenges and hypotheses
