For more than 15 years, I’ve dedicated my career to a single pursuit: bridging the gap between visionary ideas and the production-ready intelligent systems that shape our world. My journey has taken me from leading corporate R&D for global giants like Intel and BMW to my current role shaping the future of mobility as a tenured research professor.

As a technology executive, I’ve had the privilege of operating at scale—leading global R&D organizations of over 100 engineers, advising the C-suite on high-stakes M&A and IPO strategies, and delivering technology that reached millions of users across the globe. I’ve architected industry-firsts, from natural language voice assistants in vehicles to foundational safety systems for autonomous driving, always with a relentless focus on translating deep research into tangible business value and market leadership.

Now, as a Professor of Human-centered Intelligent Systems at the prestigious AI Motion Bavaria Research Institute, I am channeling that experience into building the future. My research group is pioneering the next wave of human-centric AI for automated vehicles. It’s here that I get to combine my passion for innovation with my commitment to mentoring the next generation of engineers and designers who will build our intelligent future.

This website is a living collection of that journey. A place to explore my publications, patents, and thoughts on the intersection of AI, automotive technology, and user experience.

I welcome you to explore the content here, and I am always open to connecting with fellow innovators, leaders, and researchers. Please feel free to reach out on social media or by email.
