I am a Senior Research Scientist at Intel Labs where I lead the Automated Driving Research Program across a worlwide organization of talented researchers with diverse backgrounds in Autonomous Driving, Machine Learning, Safety, Security, Human Factors and Ergonomics and Wireless Communications. 

As a researcher, I develop, software, systems and simulation tools to accelerate the adoption of safe automated driving technologies. My research interest is focused on the development of intelligent, connected, automated vehicles that augment human mobility with safer and more enjoyable experiences. 

Prior to Intel, I worked at BMW leading R&D and product development for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, Vehicle Telematics Services and Human Machine Interface Solutions in Europe, America and Asia. I received my International PhD in Computer Science from University of the Basque Country (Spain) and Clemson University (USA) in 2011.

I am a Sr. IEEE Member with 35+ peer reviewed papers, 30+ issues patents and 100+ patents pending. I have been lucky enough to have been invited to give talks to venues like MIT, DTTC, IV, EDCC, PSSOH, AutoUI, Dagstuhl, VDI, HCII or Asilomar. I have also had the pleasure of contributing to International Standards such as [IEEE P2856 - Assumptions for Models in AV Safety-Related] (https://sagroups.ieee.org/2846/) and [ETSI ITS - Collective Perception Systems] (https://www.etsi.org/committee/its).

In this page you will find contents related to my publications, talks, blog posts as well as my resume.
