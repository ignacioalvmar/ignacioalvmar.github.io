I am Professor of Human-centered Intelligent Systems at the Computer Science Faculty of the Ingolstadt University of Applied Sciences (THI). I work at the AI Motion Bavaria Research Institute at the intersection of AI, Automotive Systems and Human Computer Interaction. Besides state-of-the-art research, I teach courses in our Master programs in AI Systems Engineering and User Experience Design.  

I am also a Principal Engineer at Intel Labs where I lead the Automated Driving Research Program across a worlwide organization of talented researchers with diverse backgrounds in Autonomous Driving, Machine Learning, Safety, Security, Human Factors and Ergonomics and Wireless Communications. 

As a researcher, I develop, software, systems and simulation tools to accelerate the adoption of safe automated driving technologies. My research interest is focused on the development of intelligent, connected, automated vehicles that augment human mobility with safer and more enjoyable experiences. 

Prior to Intel, I worked at BMW leading R&D and product development for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, Vehicle Telematics Services and Human Machine Interface Solutions in Europe, America and Asia.
